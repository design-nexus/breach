# Breach Aurora verification

The screenshot uses fixture data rendered by the actual Ratatui widgets at 120×40. Run `AURORA_RENDER_DIR=/tmp/breach-renders cargo test --locked` to export SVG and text frames.

The render matrix covers 120×40, 100×30, 80×24, 60×20, 30×10, 20×8, and 1×1, plus shrinking and growing one terminal. Tests cover offline/empty screens and modal input precedence. Scan execution uses a mock Nmap binary; disk and Metasploit actions are not executed by rendering tests.

Compatibility: config/data paths retain the previous application directory; environment variables and destructive-operation confirmations retain their original behavior. No old command aliases are installed.

## Current interface

Titles now share a larger native terminal pixel font. Glim, Platter, and Luma retain theme gradients. Sweep and Breach default to Crimson and use the theme accent uniformly for their titles; Aurora remains selectable. Tab/Shift+Tab switches screens, F6/Shift+F6 switches panes, F2 opens Navigation, and Ctrl+K searches actions. See [navigation](navigation.md) for current behavior and verification.
